# LethalHealth

This is a health tracker for the [card game Epic](https://www.epiccardgame.com/).

This tracker aims to fix a couple of UX issues in the existing health tracker. Namely: the ability to add/subtract specific health amounts and the ability to easily reset both coins at the end of a turn.
